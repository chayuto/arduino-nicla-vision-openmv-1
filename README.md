### Simple Integration


## Guide and Reference
### Nicla Vision
The Arduino® Nicla Vision is a ready-to-use, standalone camera for analyzing and processing images on the edge. Thanks to its 2MP color camera, smart 6-axis motion sensor, integrated microphone and distance sensor, it is suitable for asset tracking, object recognition and predictive maintenance. Quickly implement sensor nodes to send collected data to the Arduino® Cloud (or third-party vendor services) via integrated WiFi/BLE connectivity.

### OpenMV
The OpenMV IDE is meant to provide an Arduino like experience for simple machine vision tasks using a camera sensor. In this tutorial, you will learn about some of the basic features of the OpenMV IDE and how to create a simple MicroPython script. The Nicla Vision board has OpenMV firmware on the board by default, making it easy to connect to the OpenMV IDE.
